title: Quantum Dating System
---
***This is a work in progress.***  
I am designing a Dating system, which will have 24 months a year. Every month will be of 15 to 16 day and every 4 year the last month will have 17 days beacuse of the leap year. Months will be named after The Greek Alphabets , 24 alphabet for 24 months. The System will start from 1900 , as it was the year when Max Planck gave his [Theory of Quanta](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Planck/Max_Planck_Originator_of_quantum_theory). For example, 1 January 1900 will be written as **α11** , where α is the month , the first one is Day 1 and last 1 is Year 1, or for 14 December 1900 will be **ψ141**. So , Month is written first then date and then year.
