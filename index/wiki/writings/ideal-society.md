<strong><i>This piece of words will be updated for many years. So ,this article is just a DRAFT.</i></strong><br>
<p>A society in which everyone is free to do what they want. A society in which there is no censorship of any type. A beautiful place where you could lie on smooth grass under a tree without any tension of safety or salary in your mind. Where people live in a Hightech towns instead on polluted megacities. A place where everything is powered by renewable energy. A world with no border , no wars , no poverty , no hate towards other , no discrimination and a world with no religion. A world of curious people and explorer , adventurer.</p><br>
